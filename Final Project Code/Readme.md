# Final Project

# Name - Adharsh Mahesh Kumaar

# Requirements

 - Operating System: Windows
 - MATLAB Version: R2020b

# Run Source Code

1. Clone the repository
2. Inside the Final Project Code, there are 2 functions namely (i) Straightline.m (ii) Curve.m. 
3. To visualize the results for straight line trajectory, run Straightline.m. 
4. To visualize the results for curved trajectory, run Curve.m

# Sample Output
The command window for the path tracking task of Waypoint tracking controller for a curved trajectory with variable speed for the robot is displayed.

# Reference

The data set ref_curve.txt is obtained by modifying the data set taken from [Original data set](https://github.com/peytonhong/localization/blob/master/sub_functions/Path.txt). Data points were removed from the data set to form a simpler trajectory. The controller_WP.m code and controller_stanley.m is inspired from [project01_main.m](https://github.com/peytonhong/localization/blob/master/project01_main.m)
